### What if you want your dev environment running in a docker container in the cloud and access the terminal as a web application?
âœ” Use this docker image to do just that

### Breaking the rules
* You always develop locally then go through build, test, deploy life cycle and repeat
* Your development environment must be set up on your local computer.
* You must always SSH into the box if you are given access

### How to run this docker image
```sh
$ docker run --name alpinegovim -d -e CREDENTIAL="admin:1234" -p 9000:9000 7onetella/alpinegovim:latest
```
Access the terminal on your browser by hitting http://localhost:9000
